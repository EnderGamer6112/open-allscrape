## Security Considerations

### Usage Warnings

This tool is designed for legitimate web scraping purposes. Users are responsible for:

- Respecting website Terms of Service and robots.txt
- Complying with local laws and regulations
- Not using this tool for unauthorized access or illegal activities
- Handling scraped data responsibly and with respect to privacy laws (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)

### Known Limitations

- Cloudflare and similar anti-bot systems may block requests
- Some websites explicitly prohibit automated scraping
- Rate limiting should always be considered to avoid overloading target servers
- Playwright headless browser may use significant system resources

### Best Practices

1. **Always respect robots.txt** and website scraping policies
2. **Implement rate limiting** to avoid overwhelming servers
3. **Use User-Agent headers** appropriately
4. **Handle errors gracefully** and respect retry limits
5. **Store credentials securely** if authentication is required
6. **Monitor for changes** in target website structure
7. **Cache results** when possible to reduce requests
